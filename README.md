## 📝 Description
The fashion industry is one of the most polluting in the world, and consumers are demanding more transparency and sustainability from brands. However, current environmental seals fail to provide the necessary information for informed purchasing decisions. BaoStamp emerges as a solution to these challenges, creating a global textile seal based on blockchain, using Cartesi Rollups to ensure traceability and transparency at every stage of production.

Our blockchain technology provides an immutable and reliable foundation, transparently and securely recording each transaction. This enables complete and immutable traceability of each SKU, from the origin of raw materials to the final product, promoting trust between consumers and brands.

With BaoStamp, we transform the textile industry by promoting more sustainable practices and increasing consumer confidence in ethical products. By ensuring transparency and traceability, we help brands adopt responsible practices and provide consumers with the necessary information for conscious choices. BaoStamp is ready to lead the transformation of the textile industry towards a more sustainable future. 🌍
