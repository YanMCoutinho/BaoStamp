## üìù Description
The fashion industry is one of the most polluting in the world, and consumers are demanding more transparency and sustainability from brands. However, current environmental seals fail to provide the necessary information for informed purchasing decisions. BaoStamp emerges as a solution to these challenges, creating a global textile seal based on blockchain, using Cartesi Rollups to ensure traceability and transparency at every stage of production.

Our blockchain technology provides an immutable and reliable foundation, transparently and securely recording each transaction. This enables complete and immutable traceability of each SKU, from the origin of raw materials to the final product, promoting trust between consumers and brands.

With BaoStamp, we transform the textile industry by promoting more sustainable practices and increasing consumer confidence in ethical products. By ensuring transparency and traceability, we help brands adopt responsible practices and provide consumers with the necessary information for conscious choices. BaoStamp is ready to lead the transformation of the textile industry towards a more sustainable future. üåç


## üíª Setup for Development and Code Execution

*Add the necessary information about prerequisites (IDEs, libraries, services, etc.) and basic installation of the project, describing any versions used. Provide a step-by-step guide on how the reader can download the code and run the application from their local machine.*

*Example instructions*

Here are all the instructions necessary for installing all the essential programs, libraries, and tools to configure the development environment.

1. Download and install Cartesi: [https://docs.cartesi.io](https://docs.cartesi.io) (version 1.3)
2. Clone the repository in question.
3. In administrator mode, open "Ubuntu" and then open the "src/cartesi-backend" folder in the root directory of the cloned repository and type the following command:

```sh
command here
```

This will install all the dependencies defined in the <b>package.json</b> file that are necessary to run the project. Now the project is ready to be modified. If you still want to start the application, type the command below in the terminal:

```sh
yarn start
```

4. Now open the "frontend/frontend" folder and run the following command:

```sh
yarn
yarn codegen
yarn start
```

5. Now you can access the application through the link http://localhost:1234/
6. The server is online.
